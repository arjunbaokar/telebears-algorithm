telebears-algorithm
===================

implementing the algorithm for Hella-BEARS

PRIORITY TO-DO:
 - write tests
    + see if it is actually better than current system (run comparison tests)
 - scrape information and store in XML file (basically implement input to algorithm)
    + use this as a json feed into the algorithm

TO-DO:
 - implement unit cap
 - account for multiple same-priority class options for Student
 - test for large cases
 - increase efficiency (probably)

LONG-TERM TO-DO:
 - create website so students can provide class input
    + improve usability of aforementioned website and refine the system (it's almost like we care about the users)
